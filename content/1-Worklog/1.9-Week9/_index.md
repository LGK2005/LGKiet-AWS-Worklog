* Learn cost and usage analysis using AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.
* Start designing the dashboard for the workshop.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Mon | Family funeral. <br> Spent the entire day with family and funeral arrangements, no study or project work done. | 03/11/2025 | 03/11/2025 | – |
