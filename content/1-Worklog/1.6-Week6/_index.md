### Week 6 Objectives:

* Discuss about proposal and workshop.
* Learn Blender and make my own 3D model.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 2 | Learned Blender basics for 3D modeling. <br> Followed beginner tutorials to understand the interface, object manipulation, modifiers, and basic lighting/rendering. <br> Created a first 3D product and exported the final render. <br><br> Final product: [Blender render](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aAOMoHdeUgXSEGXfX6zxjZibZQ2hB8la/view?usp=sharing). | 13/10/2025 | 13/10/2025 | - |
| 3 | Team meeting. <br> Revised workshop proposal: focused on using GuardDuty for intrusion detection instead of a custom Lambda function due to the need for a large dataset and extensive development time. <br> Redrew AWS architecture: added GuardDuty replacing CloudWatch Alarm. <br> Wrote a draft of the proposal outlining basic functions and providing a rough cost estimate. | 14/10/2025 | 14/10/2025 | – |
| 4 | Team meeting. <br> Revised workshop proposal: <br> &emsp; + Incorporated the use of EventBridge. <br> &emsp; + Recalculated costs by reducing the EC2 instance type and active hours. <br> Updated AWS architecture diagram to include the EventBridge icon and connections. | 15/10/2025 | 15/10/2025 | – |
| 5 | Updated AWS architecture: <br> &emsp; + Rearranged icons for clearer connections. <br> &emsp; + Moved SSM inside the Region group. <br> &emsp; + Added public subnet group for the EC2 instance. <br> Installed Amazon Q for enhanced proposal analytics. <br> Revised workshop proposal: recalculated cost using AWS Pricing Calculator. | 16/10/2025 | 16/10/2025 | - |
| 6 | Family matters. <br> No study or workshop work completed on this day. | 17/10/2025 | 17/10/2025 | – |

### Week 6 Achievements:

* Made significant progress on the workshop proposal and architecture, iterating on design, cost optimization, and tooling (GuardDuty, EventBridge, Amazon Q, AWS Pricing Calculator).
* Successfully prepared and deployed proposal materials and worklog updates to GitHub Pages.
* Learned Blender fundamentals and completed a first 3D product render as a side skill.
* Managed priorities between project work, study planning, and family responsibilities during the week.
