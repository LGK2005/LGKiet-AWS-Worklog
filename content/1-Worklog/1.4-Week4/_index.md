### Week 4 Objectives:
- Complete Module 6 (Amazon RDS)
- Start on proposal
- Explore a non-AWS technology (Three.js) to avoid burnout
- Learn about ThreeJS

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Mon | Module 6 – Amazon RDS (Part 1): <br> &emsp; + Reviewed relational database fundamentals in the context of managed services on AWS. <br> &emsp; + Learned the high-level overview and main benefits of Amazon RDS compared to self-managed databases on EC2 (managed backups, patching, scaling, Multi-AZ, read replicas). <br> &emsp; + Studied which database engines are supported on RDS (Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server). <br> &emsp; + Compared when to use RDS versus DynamoDB, Redshift, Neptune, ElastiCache, and S3 for different workloads. | 29/09/2025 | 29/09/2025 | [Amazon RDS – Introduction](https://000005.awsstudygroup.com/vi/1-introduce/) |
| Tue | Module 6 – Amazon RDS (Part 2): <br> &emsp; + Learned about RDS management features: automated backups, snapshots, maintenance windows, software patching, and event notifications via SNS. <br> &emsp; + Studied encryption at rest and in transit for RDS using AWS KMS and SSL, and how to create encrypted DB instances from encrypted snapshots. <br> &emsp; + Reviewed DB subnet groups and VPC design for RDS by placing DB instances in private subnets across multiple AZs. <br> &emsp; + Learned about main pricing components for RDS: instance hours, storage, IOPS, backup storage, and Multi-AZ. | 30/09/2025 | 30/09/2025 | [Amazon RDS – Management & Security](https://000005.awsstudygroup.com/vi/1-introduce/) |
| Wed | Module 6 – Amazon RDS (Part 3): <br> &emsp; + Studied performance aspects such as storage types (gp2, Provisioned IOPS, magnetic) and their use cases. <br> &emsp; + Learned how Multi-AZ deployments work, typical failover scenarios, and how DNS endpoints are updated during failover. <br> &emsp; + Reviewed Read Replicas for scaling read workloads and basic high-availability and disaster recovery patterns across AZs and Regions. <br> &emsp; + Read about snapshots, restores, and migration options using Database Migration Service (DMS) and Schema Conversion Tool (SCT). | 01/10/2025 | 01/10/2025 | [Amazon RDS – Performance, Multi-AZ & Read Replicas](https://000005.awsstudygroup.com/vi/1-introduce/) |
| Thu | Three.js study: <br> &emsp; + Researched what Three.js is and how it builds on top of WebGL to render 3D graphics in the browser. <br> &emsp; + Learned core concepts: Scene, Camera, Renderer, Mesh, Geometry, Material, and basic lighting. <br> &emsp; + Followed introductory examples to render a simple rotating 3D object and experimented with camera controls. <br> &emsp; + Collected ideas on how Three.js could be used for interactive visualizations in the project. | 02/10/2025 | 02/10/2025 | [Three.js Documentation](https://threejs.org/) |
| Fri | Joined the “AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering” event. | 03/10/2025 | 04/10/2025 | |

### Week 4 Achievements:

* Built a solid theoretical understanding of Amazon RDS, including engines, security, networking, Multi-AZ, and Read Replica patterns.
* Clarified RDS positioning compared to other AWS data services such as DynamoDB, Redshift, Neptune, ElastiCache, and S3.
* Took a healthy break from AWS-focused content by learning Three.js fundamentals and experimenting with basic 3D scenes for future project ideas.
* Continued project and learning activities by attending an AI-focused event and translating two technical blog posts.
